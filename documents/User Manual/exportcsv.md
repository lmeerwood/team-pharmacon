## File Types

The options that are presented for download are CSV, XLSX or JSON. If the data is going to be manipulated via a spreadsheet editor it suggested to use download either a CSV or XLSX file. CSV will result in a smaller file, while XLSX will allow for more complicated features to later be saved in the file; charts, equations, etc. JSON is only recommended for web development use.
